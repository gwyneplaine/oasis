This module resets a few basic values for the body, img and svg elements.

Note: this reset does **not** set box-sizing to border-box using the universal selector.
This is meant to discourage declaring widths unnecessarily throughout a stylesheet.
The base form, grid, and flex-object modules use border-box where widths are used.

If you would like to declare box-sizing border-box, use
[tachyon-box-sizing](https://github.com/mrmrs/tachyons-box-sizing), which is fully compatible with Basscss.

This reset intentionally does not normalize cross-browser discrepancies. If you would like to normalize styles, use [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
